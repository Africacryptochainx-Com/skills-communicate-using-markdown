              api_key = generate_api_key()
              hashed_data = hash_data("user_data")
              secure_communication(api_key, hashed_data)
              print("Secure infrastructure implemented.")

          def generate_api_key():
              return hashlib.sha256("your_random_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()

          def hash_data(data):
              secret_key = b'your_secret_key'
              return hmac.new(secret_key, data.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

          def secure_communication(api_key, data):
              # Implement secure communication logic here
