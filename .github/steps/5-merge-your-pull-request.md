## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Great job adding a task list to the file :heart:_

Now it's time to bring all your changes into the main branch. Merging your pull request will integrate the new features and improvements into your project.

### What does it mean to merge a pull request?

Merging is the process of combining your code changes from a feature branch into the main branch. This step is crucial as it finalizes your work and makes it part of the main project. You can learn more about merging from the [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge).

This step ensures that your contributions are now part of the main codebase, moving us closer to our project goals.
