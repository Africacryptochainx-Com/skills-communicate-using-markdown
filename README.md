```

### Python Code for Secure Infrastructure

```python
import hashlib
import hmac

def secure_infrastructure():
    api_key = generate_api_key()
    hashed_data = hash_data("user_data")
    secure_communication(api_key, hashed_data)
    print("Secure infrastructure implemented.")

def generate_api_key():
    return hashlib.sha256("your_random_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()

def hash_data(data):
    secret_key = b'your_secret_key'
    return hmac.new(secret_key, data.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

def secure_communication(api_key, data):
    pass

secure_infrastructure()
```

## Welcome

GitHub is about more than code. It’s a platform for software collaboration, and Markdown is one of the most important ways developers can make their communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests. This course will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you’ve completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
- **What you'll learn**: Use Markdown to add lists, images, and links in a comment or text file.
- **What you'll build**: We'll update a plain text file and add Markdown formatting, and you can use this file to start your own GitHub Pages site.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with pull requests as well as edit files. If these things aren't familiar to you, we recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course, first!
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Add headers
2. Add an image
3. Add a code example
4. Make a task list
5. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'communicate-using-markdown',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-communicate-using-markdown',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=communicate-using-markdown&owner=%40me&name=skills-communicate-using-markdown&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
